# O
## Overview
O consists of 2 core elements: Knower and O Daemon. In general O's purpose is to act as a personal AI based a user's digital data and behaviour. The purpose is to create a complete personal AI that one can use:
* to learn from their past data
* as an assistant to automate tasks across web apps, APIs, OS, native apps, smarthome, etc.

Overtime and use at scale, O will be guided to learn/replicate all of the functionality that currently exists across all SaaS and native apps as modular nuggets of functionality. These modules of functionality will be the foundation of a new AI-first OS architecture.
### Knower
Knower is the RAG (vector DB + data sources + LLM connect) and chat app (text and voice).  
### O Daemon
O Daemon is the background process that is always collecting user data across all devices, OSs, and devices. It also pipes all that data into Knower.
